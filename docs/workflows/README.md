# GitHub Actions Workflows Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for automated workflows and CI/CD processes for the holo-code-gen project.

## Overview

This documentation provides templates and guidance for implementing robust CI/CD pipelines specifically designed for photonic neural network toolchain development.

## Workflow Architecture

*Note: Actual workflow files must be created manually in `.github/workflows/` directory*

### Required Workflows

#### 1. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)

```yaml
# Example CI workflow structure
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -e ".[dev]"
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
      - name: Check code quality
        run: |
          black --check .
          ruff check .
          mypy src/
```

#### 2. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)

```yaml
# Example security workflow structure
name: Security
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Bandit
        run: bandit -r src/
      - name: Dependency scan
        run: safety check
```

#### 3. Documentation Build (`docs.yml`)

```yaml
# Example documentation workflow structure
name: Documentation
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build docs
        run: |
          pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme
          sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build/
```

#### 4. Release (`release.yml`)

```yaml
# Example release workflow structure
name: Release
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build package
        run: python -m build
      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        with:
          password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
```

## Workflow Integration Points

### Pre-commit Hooks

- Code formatting and linting
- Security scanning
- Photonic parameter validation
- PDK security checks

### Branch Protection

Recommended branch protection rules:

- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Include administrators in restrictions

### Secrets Management

Required secrets for workflows:

- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For package publishing
- `PDK_ACCESS_TOKEN`: For foundry PDK access (if applicable)
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For coverage reporting

## Performance Testing

### Benchmark Workflows

- Automated performance regression testing
- Memory usage monitoring
- Compilation time tracking
- Simulation accuracy validation

### Photonic-Specific Testing

- Layout DRC validation
- Optical simulation accuracy
- PDK compatibility testing
- Process variation analysis

## Deployment Strategies

### Package Distribution

- PyPI releases for stable versions
- Test PyPI for release candidates
- GitHub releases for source distributions
- Container images for simulation environments

### Documentation Deployment

- Read the Docs integration
- GitHub Pages for examples
- API documentation updates

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Build Health

- Failed build notifications
- Performance regression alerts
- Security vulnerability notifications
- Dependency update alerts

### Quality Metrics

- Test coverage tracking
- Code quality trends
- Security scan results
- Documentation completeness

## Manual Setup Required

The following items require manual configuration:

1. Create `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Add workflow YAML files based on examples above
3. Configure repository secrets
4. Set up branch protection rules
5. Configure integrations (Codecov, Read the Docs, etc.)
6. Set up monitoring and alerting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- PDK access authentication failures
- Large file handling in workflows
- Simulation environment setup
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Debug Strategies

- Workflow log analysis
- Local reproduction steps
- Incremental testing approach
- Environment isolation techniques
